from OmniGenAI_toolkit import ModelManager, StreamlitApp

# Initialize model manager
model_manager = ModelManager(model_name="gpt-3")

# Create a Streamlit app
app = StreamlitApp(title="Chatbot Application")

@app.add_chat_interface(model_manager)
def chat_interface(user_input):
    response = model_manager.generate_response(user_input)
    return response

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
